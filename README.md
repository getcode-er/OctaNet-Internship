**Task Name :**
***----ATM MACHINE SIMULATION using PYTHON----***




**# Functions to Include:**

   >*1. Account balance inquiry* 
   
   >*2. Cash withdrawal*
   
   >*3. Cash deposit*    
   
   >*4. PIN change*
   
   >*5. Transaction history*

Sample Accounts to use, this are in the code if you want to change you can change:

      Account no. - 1234567890
      PIN - 1234 
      Available amount - 1000      
     
      Account no. - 9876543210
      PIN - 5678 
      Available amount - 500


**Here are some key points from the above ATM simulation code:**


*Class-Based Approach:*

> The code defines an ATM class to encapsulate account details and operations.

*Encapsulation of Account Details:*

> Each account has attributes: *account_number, pin, balance, and transaction_history.*

> Every deposit, withdrawal, and PIN change is recorded with a timestamp.


*Security Measures:*

> PIN verification allows only 3 attempts before locking the account.


*User-Friendly ATM Menu:*

> Provides options to access various banking operations.

*Error Handling:*

> Prevents overdrawing from the account.

> Ensures deposits are positive values.

> Ensures only valid menu choices are accepted.

*Dictionary-Based Account Management:*

> A dictionary (accounts) stores multiple ATM objects for different account holders.


*Simulation of an ATM Machine:*

> Uses a loop to interact with the user until they exit.
